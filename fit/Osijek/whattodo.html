						<h3>Visit Kopacki Rit</h3>
							<p>The greenest waters and forests in the whole of Slavonia are to be found in Kopački rit Nature Park. The park covers the wetland area around the confluence of Drava and Danube rivers, near Osijek, covering a total of 238 hectares, and which, due to its inaccessibility, has remained in the intact state since the olden times. Kopački rit is one of the largest natural wetlands in Europe and as such has been recommended for inclusion in the UNESCO List of Natural Heritage. </p>

						<h3>Visit Wine Cellars</h3>
							<p>From all sides the city of Osijek is surrounded by vast vineyards on the Danube river and on the slopes of Papuk mountain, where some of the most famous, largest and oldest (13th, 15th and 16th century) Croatian and even regional wineries produce their golden wine drops. But on the other hand, there are only two wine tasting bars in Osijek. The reason for this is the proximity of vintners and their wine cellars.</p>

						<h3>Visit Old Town Tvrda</h3>
							<p>Osijek's Tvrdja complex was built in the 18th century with impressive defensive walls and town gates, Romanic nucleus and rectangular main square, so the Osijek is the most important military, economic, administrative and cultural center of Slavonia. Preserved in Tvrdja are beautiful aristocratic and citizen buildings, Baroque circular pillar of the Holy Trinity (1729-1730), fountain, Museum of Slavonia building, old gymnasium, church of St. Michael with valuable inventory and accessories (kept here is the chalice with enamel medallions with images from the life of St. Francis Xavier, with a stamp from Vienna from 1764).</p>
