				<p class="dark">In just under a few hours from Zagreb heading east, you will reach the amazing county of Osijek-Baranja. This area of Croatia is full of wine roads, agriculture, rich tradition and amazing Nature. </p>
				<p > Osijek is the 4th largest city in Croatia and has an old fortress which can’t be missed in the old town known as,Tvrda. Tvrda hosts many events throughout the year, so always be sure to see what is happening during your visit. Wine roads surround the small villages and traditional houses can still be visited where the wine is made and stored. Some houses have even transformed into tasting rooms. </p>
				
				<p>The oldest and largest wineries also are located in this county and have unique views of castles and the Danube River. Kopacki Rit Nature Park is full of more than 300 species of birds and other wildlife. You can take a boat tour through the park and enjoy the breathtaking nature. <a href="http://ergela-djakovo.hr/en/" target="_blank">The Lipizzaner Stud Farm</a> has two locations in Dakovo where you can see the horses take their morning run at Ivandvor or go into the city and see a touristic show. Throughout the county you will also find many small villages where you can explore castles and appreciate the Baroque and Tudor styles.</p>

				<p>Osijek remains a popular domestic tourist destination for its Baroque style, open spaces and ample recreational opportunities. The most important sights in the city include the main square, Trg Ante Starčevića, Tvrđa the 18th century Baroque citadel, the promenade along the Drava ("promenada"), and the suspension pedestrian bridge toward Baranja.[citation needed]
				<p>Osijek has it's own beer brewery. <a href="https://pivovara.hr/?lang=en" target="_blank">Osječko</a> is the first Croatian beer ever produced, and has been produced since 1697. The main factory is located in Osijek, from which the beer got its name.</p>
				The Municipal Park of King Petar Krešimir IV and the Tomislav Park date from the beginning of the 20th century, and are protected national landmarks. Osijek is also home to one of the few Croatian zoological gardens, along the Drava river. The city is home to a monument to Ante Starčević.

				The Co-cathedral of St. Peter and Paul is a Neo-Gothic structure with the second highest tower in Croatia after the Zagreb Cathedral. The tower measure 90 m (295.28 ft) and can be seen from throughout Osijek. Because of its size most locals refer to it as the cathedral but it is only a parish church. The Church of St Peter and St Paul was designed by Franz Langenberg and contains 40 stained glass windows</p>
